## Instructions

Embark on recreating the expected layout by utilizing the `index.html` and `style.css` files provided in this folder. Your primary focus should be on crafting the layout and applying styles as outlined. This phase does not require the implementation of functionality, allowing you to concentrate on building a visually appealing and structured layout for the project.

## Mobile Responsiveness
